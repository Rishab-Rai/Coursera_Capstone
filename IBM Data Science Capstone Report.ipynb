Attributes used to weigh the severity of an accident are 'WEATHER', 'ROADCOND' and 'LIGHTCOND'.\n\nSeverity codes are as follows:\n1. Little to no Probability (Clear Conditions)\n2. Very Low Probability - Chance or Property Damage\n3. Low Probability - Chance of Injury\n4. Mild Probability - Chance of Serious Injury\n5. High Probability - Chance of Fatality\n"
